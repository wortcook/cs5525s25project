# LLM Security Infrastructure Project: Comprehensive Summary (Dry Run)

## Project Purpose & Threat Model

This project implements a modular, multi-layer security system for Large Language Models (LLMs) on Google Cloud Platform. Its primary goal is to filter and block malicious prompts—including prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, adversarial inputs, and spam—before they reach the LLM. The system is designed for scalability, observability, research extensibility, and production reliability.

## Architecture & Data Flow

```
User Request → BFilter (Bayesian) → SFilter (Transformer) → LLM Stub
                     ↓ (if jailbreak detected)
               Pub/Sub → GCS Storage (for audit/event logging)
```
- **BFilter**: Fast, statistical filter for initial screening.
- **SFilter**: Deep learning-based filter for nuanced detection.
- **LLM Stub**: Placeholder for the actual LLM (can be replaced with a real model).
- **Pub/Sub & GCS**: Capture and store detected jailbreak attempts for auditing, research, and retraining.
- **Feedback Loop**: Logged jailbreaks are reviewed and can be used for analytics, retraining, and improving filter models, closing the loop for continuous improvement.

## Component Summaries

### 1. BFilter (Primary Bayesian Filter)
- **Role**: First line of defense using a Naive Bayes classifier for fast, statistical filtering.
- **Key Features**: Pre-trained model, request caching, public web interface, configurable threshold, message validation, Pub/Sub event publishing.
- **Implementation**: Flask app, scikit-learn, joblib, Google Cloud authentication, Cloud Run (port 8082).
- **Logic**: Blocks high-confidence threats, forwards uncertain cases to SFilter, logs detected jailbreaks via Pub/Sub.

### 2. SFilter (Secondary Transformer Filter)
- **Role**: Deep learning-based filter for messages that pass BFilter, using a HuggingFace transformer model.
- **Key Features**: Model loaded from GCS, CUDA support, reduced token limits, confidence threshold, health checks, error handling.
- **Implementation**: Flask app, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Cloud Run (port 8083, internal-only).
- **Logic**: Returns 401 for detected jailbreaks (triggers logging), 200 for clean messages.

### 3. LLM Stub
- **Role**: Placeholder for the actual LLM service, currently echoes input.
- **Key Features**: Minimal Flask app, health/readiness endpoints, internal-only (port 8081).
- **Integration**: Receives messages from BFilter after filtering; can be replaced with a real LLM or API endpoint.

### 4. Model Downloader
- **Role**: Downloads models from HuggingFace and uploads to GCS for SFilter.
- **Key Features**: Automated download/upload, Cloud Run job, supports large models, can be triggered for updates.
- **Implementation**: Python script using huggingface_hub and google-cloud-storage.

### 5. Infrastructure & Supporting Services
- **Cloud Run**: Serverless container hosting, auto-scaling, internal/external access as needed.
- **VPC & Networking**: Custom VPC, subnets, VPC connectors, firewall rules for isolation and security.
- **Cloud Storage**: Buckets for model storage and event logging, IAM for access control.
- **Pub/Sub**: Event streaming for detected jailbreaks, storage subscription for audit logs.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Health checks, latency alerts, email notifications, custom metrics endpoints.

## Security Architecture
- **IAM**: Least-privilege service accounts for each component.
- **VPC Isolation**: Only BFilter is public; all other services are internal.
- **Data Protection**: No persistent user message storage; only detected threats are logged (via Pub/Sub to GCS).

## Monitoring, Alerting & Configuration
- **Endpoints**: All services expose `/health`, `/ready`, and `/metrics` endpoints.
- **Metrics**: Latency, error rates, cache size, uptime, request counts.
- **Alerting**: Cloud Monitoring triggers alerts for high latency (>100ms), service failures, or unhealthy endpoints.
- **Configuration**: Thresholds, resource allocations, and model paths set via environment variables and Terraform variables.

## Deployment & Cost Optimization
- **Deployment**: Automated with Terraform and setup scripts; includes API enablement, network setup, and service deployment.
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-request, auto-scaling, minimal base images, storage lifecycle management.

## Extensibility, Limitations & Use Cases
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy replacement or extension of filters, models, or the LLM backend.
- **Limitations**: Cold start latency, possible false positives/negatives, model drift, operational complexity, need for regular model updates.
- **Use Cases**: Academic research, production LLM APIs, security benchmarking, rapid prototyping.

## Example Workflow
1. User sends a prompt to the public BFilter endpoint.
2. BFilter blocks or forwards the message to SFilter based on confidence.
3. SFilter blocks (logs) or passes the message to the LLM Stub.
4. Detected jailbreaks are logged to GCS for review and retraining.
5. Researchers or operators analyze logs and update models or thresholds as needed.

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust, scalable, and research-friendly LLM security infrastructure, balancing performance, security, and extensibility for both academic and production use. Its modular design and comprehensive logging make it ideal for experimentation, benchmarking, and future enhancements.
