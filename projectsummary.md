# CS5525 LLM Security Infrastructure Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-layer security system for Large Language Models (LLMs)** designed to filter malicious prompts and jailbreak attempts before they reach the actual LLM service. The system is built on Google Cloud Platform using serverless architecture for horizontal scalability and cost optimization.

### Threat Model

The system addresses several categories of LLM security threats:

1. **Jailbreak Attempts**: Prompts designed to bypass safety guardrails and extract harmful content
2. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious instructions embedded within legitimate-looking requests
3. **Social Engineering**: Attempts to manipulate the model into revealing sensitive information
4. **Adversarial Prompts**: Carefully crafted inputs designed to exploit model vulnerabilities
5. **Content Policy Violations**: Requests for illegal, harmful, or inappropriate content

### Attack Mitigation Strategy

The defense-in-depth approach provides multiple interception points:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Fast Bayesian classification catches known attack patterns
- **Deep Learning Detection**: Transformer models identify sophisticated, novel attempts
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Pattern recognition across request sequences
- **Content Logging**: Audit trail for security analysis and model improvement

## Architecture

The system follows a **cascading filter architecture** with three main processing stages:

```
User Request → BFilter (Bayesian) → SFilter (Transformer) → LLM Stub
                     ↓ (if jailbreak detected)
               Pub/Sub → GCS Storage
```

### Data Flow and Feedback Loops

**Request Processing Flow**:
1. **Input Validation**: Message length and format validation
2. **Primary Classification**: Fast Bayesian analysis with caching
3. **Secondary Analysis**: Transformer-based deep inspection (if needed)
4. **Threat Logging**: Detected attacks logged to Pub/Sub → GCS
5. **Response Delivery**: Clean requests forwarded to LLM service

**Research and Training Feedback**:
- **Threat Intelligence**: All detected attacks logged with metadata for analysis
- **Model Performance**: Classification confidence scores tracked for tuning
- **False Positive Analysis**: Legitimate requests that trigger filters are logged
- **Continuous Learning**: Collected data enables periodic model retraining
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Infrastructure supports model comparison studies

**Data Storage Strategy**:
- **No Persistent User Data**: Messages not stored unless classified as threats
- **Audit Trail**: Complete threat detection pipeline logging
- **Research Dataset**: Anonymized attack patterns for academic research
- **Performance Metrics**: System latency and accuracy measurements

### Key Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: Fast initial filtering (< 10ms) using Bayesian classification
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of detection with increasing sophistication
3. **Scalable**: Cloud-native serverless architecture with automatic scaling
4. **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
5. **Cost Effective**: Pay-per-request model with efficient resource utilization

## Component Analysis

### 1. BFilter (Primary Bayesian Filter)

**Purpose**: Fast statistical analysis using Naive Bayes classification for initial threat detection.

**Key Features**:
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses scikit-learn Naive Bayes classifier with CountVectorizer
- **Performance**: Sub-10ms response times for most requests
- **Caching**: MD5-based request caching to avoid reprocessing identical messages
- **Web Interface**: Public-facing HTML form for testing and demonstration
- **Request Validation**: Message length limits and input sanitization
- **Threshold-based Routing**: Configurable confidence threshold (default: 0.9)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Flask web server with gunicorn WSGI
- Model artifacts (model.pkl, cv.pkl) built during container creation
- Training data preprocessing with `dataprep.py`
- Google Cloud authentication for internal service calls
- Pub/Sub integration for event logging

**Key Code Patterns**:
```python
# Structured logging implementation
class StructuredLogger:
    def _log(self, level: str, message: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        log_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "level": level,
            "service": self.service_name,
            "message": message,
            **kwargs
        }
        self.logger.info(json.dumps(log_entry))

# Error handling decorator
@handle_errors
def endpoint_handler():
    # Automatic error handling and logging
    pass

# Circuit breaker for external calls
@retry_with_backoff(max_retries=3)
def make_service_call():
    # Exponential backoff with failure handling
    pass
```

**Decision Logic**:
```python
# BFilter decision flow implementation
if bayesian_confidence >= threshold:
    structured_logger.info("Request blocked by primary filter", 
                          confidence=bayesian_confidence, threshold=threshold)
    return {"blocked": True, "reason": "Primary filter detection"}
else:
    # Forward to SFilter for secondary analysis
    response = make_authenticated_post_request(sfilter_url, data)
    if response.status_code == 401:  # Jailbreak detected
        publish_to_pubsub(message_data)  # Log for analysis
        return {"blocked": True, "reason": "Secondary filter detection"}
    else:
        # Forward to LLM service
        return forward_to_llmstub(data)
```

### 2. SFilter (Secondary Transformer Filter)

**Purpose**: Sophisticated transformer-based classification for messages that pass the initial filter.

**Key Features**:
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Uses `jackhhao/jailbreak-classifier` transformer model
- **Model Optimization**: CUDA acceleration when available, optimized pipeline settings
- **GCS Mount**: Model loaded from Google Cloud Storage for faster cold starts
- **Performance Tuning**: Reduced token limits (512 vs 8192) for faster processing
- **Resource Scaling**: Configurable memory allocation (default: 4Gi)

**Technical Implementation**:
- PyTorch-based transformer pipeline
- Model pre-loading during container startup
- Health checks with model validation
- Error handling and fallback responses
- Confidence-based classification with configurable thresholds

**Model Loading Pattern**:
```python
# Lazy loading for memory optimization
def load_models():
    global model_pipeline
    if model_pipeline is None:
        gc.collect()  # Memory optimization
        structured_logger.info("Loading transformer model", 
                              model_path=os.environ.get('SECONDARY_MODEL'))
        
        model_pipeline = pipeline(
            "text-classification",
            model=model_path,
            max_length=512,  # Optimized for performance
            truncation=True,
            device=0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
        )
        gc.collect()
        structured_logger.info("Model loaded successfully")
```

### Port Configuration:
- **BFilter**: Port 8082 (public access)
- **SFilter**: Port 8083 (internal only) 
- **LLM Stub**: Port 8081 (internal only)

**Processing Flow**:

  validation {
    condition     = var.bfilter_threshold >= 0.0 && var.bfilter_threshold <= 1.0
    error_message = "Threshold must be between 0.0 and 1.0."
  }
}

# main.tf - Service deployment with configuration
module "bfilter_service" {
  source = "./modules/cloud-run-service"
  
  service_name = "bfilter"
  container_image = "gcr.io/${var.project_id}/bfilter:latest"
  
  environment_variables = {
    BFILTER_THRESHOLD     = var.bfilter_threshold
    MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH    = var.max_message_length
    ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING = var.enable_request_logging
    PROJECT_ID           = var.project_id
    SFILTER_URL          = module.sfilter_service.service_url
    LLMSTUB_URL          = module.llmstub_service.service_url
  }
  
  resource_limits = {
    memory = "4Gi"

## Operational Improvements
- **Operational Playbook:**
  - Document step-by-step procedures for:
    - Updating models (using the model-downloader job and GCS bucket)
    - Adjusting thresholds and configuration (via Terraform and environment variables)
    - Debugging failed deployments (using Cloud Run logs, health endpoints, and metrics)
    - Rolling back changes (using Terraform state and container image tags)
    - Monitoring and alerting setup (Cloud Monitoring dashboards, alert policies)
    - Performing health checks and readiness validation
- **Security Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews of IAM, network, and container security settings.
- **Cost Audits:** Periodically review resource usage and optimize allocations for cost savings.

## Known Limitations
- **Cold Start Latency:** Cloud Run cold starts may add initial latency, especially for SFilter with large models.
- **Model Size Limits:** GCS mount and Cloud Run memory limits may restrict the size of deployable models.
- **False Positives/Negatives:** Filtering is not perfect; thresholds and models may require ongoing tuning.
- **GCS Mount Caveats:** Ensure correct permissions and region alignment for GCS bucket mounts; monitor for mount failures.
- **Operational Complexity:** Multi-service, multi-cloud-component architecture requires careful monitoring and maintenance.
- **Source Code Port Configuration:** The `sfilter/src/server.py` file incorrectly specifies port 8082 instead of 8083, which conflicts with BFilter. The Dockerfile correctly configures port 8083, but the development server configuration needs correction.
